				<p>The tower begins to open up, and you are standing by the tower on The Curtain Wall. You don't dare 
				look over towards the sea, as the height is making you queasy. Instead, you focus on looking toward the 
				ruined North Range. As you stand, rooted to the stone and handrail, someone comes over to make sure you 
				are okay. As you nod, they point to the Douglas Tower and tell you of a Red Lady that haunts the tower. 
				It is believed she was the wife of a Red Douglas, as they owned the castle for more than 300 years. They 
				continue over the wall, as you make haste back down the stairs you came.
