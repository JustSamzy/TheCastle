				<p>The stairs heading into the lower floor of The Douglas Tower are dark, with artificial lighting guiding 
				the way. The stairwell is surprising solid with no significant damage to the walls within it, but you can 
				hear the sea wind battering off the outer wall. The Douglas Tower used to stand 6 storeys high, with the 
				lower levels used as a pit prison. This notorious prison has been described as a hideous cavern, with its 
				prisoners fully aware of the steep dive into the sea below. The air inside the stairway is much colder than 
				anywhere else, it sends a slight chill down your spine.
