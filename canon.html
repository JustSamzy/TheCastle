				<p>This castle was built before the age of gunpowder, so in Williamâ€™s day the thick high curtain walls 
				defended against weapons of the time such as stone-throwing machines and battering rams. But when gunpowder
				came along, later Earl owners added gun holes to fire from and filled passages in the landward curtain wall
				with masonry. One of these gun holes was in the lower hall block, pointing out towards the sea to help defend the 
				castle against ships. Gunners were rewarded in 1548 for firing on English Ships during an encounter on the 
				Firth of the Forth. You can now choose to continue towards the cliff-side, or head back to the hallway 
				entrance.
