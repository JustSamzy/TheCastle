				<p>The next section of the North Range has been closed off due to the cliff-side eroding and has made it 
				dangerous. But as you look around you take in the magnificent view of the sea. You can see Bass Rock in 
				the distance, and the natural gap where ships would dock at the castle. The sea waves are crashing 
				against the castleâ€™s steep cliff side, and you find it very relaxing. As you turn round to head back 
				you are met with the castle almost towering over you, even though in ruins, you still find it rather 
				intimating. In its time, it would have been monumental sight, taking the breath away of all who approached 
				its walls by land or sea.
