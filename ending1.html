				<p>Thankfully, this tourist attraction is rather popular, your scream was heard, and you were taken to the nearest 
				hospital. However, you suffered a serious head injury and after a short time, you fell into a coma. Some people 
				believe this was just a freak accident and that you will recover. Yet others believe the reason you are in a coma, 
				is because your soul never really left the pit prison. The music was a calling or a warning, and once you entered 
				the prison you were never to leave. It is possible that you are now a lost soul, trapped in The Castle.
