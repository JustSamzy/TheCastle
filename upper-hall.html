				<p>You enter the Upper Hall Block to find the roof completely missing, as well as most of the walls in 
				tatters. The hall is empty with timber flooring, similar to what would have been there originally. 
				Looking up towards Douglas Tower you can see the indentations of where roof panels would have been. 
				This hall would have been the home to splendid banquets, where the Red Douglases would parade their wealth 
				to other notable nobles. Someone approaches you and says "Itâ€™s such a shame this hall fell into such 
				disarray. The ghost of the 6th Earl of Douglas must be upset! Otherwise, why else would he make an 
				appearance?" They point towards the Castle and then heads back down the way they came.
