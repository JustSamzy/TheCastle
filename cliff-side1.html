				<p>You come to a fence which stops you from going any further. As you look down, you can see the remains 
				of part of the castle as well as parts which have been washed away by the eroding cliff side. This part 
				of the castle once housed extra accommodation as well as a sea-gate, to allow the castle to gain supplies 
				from the sea if hardships arose and they could not get access via the land which would happen regularly 
				thanks to the Red Douglases conflict with the Scottish crown when English relations got too cosy. With 
				nowhere left to go in the Inner Court, you head back towards the well to explore further.
