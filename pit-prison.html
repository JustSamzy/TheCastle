				<p>You enter the pit prison via a small landing. The prison is small and damp. This would have been a prison 
				for the lowliest and most serious offenders, with the smallest slither of light on the cliff-side wall. 
				The air is stale and even colder than in the stairway to the stage it makes the hairs on your neck stand-up. 
				As you head up the stairs to leave, you realise there is now a solid wooden door blocking the stairway. 
				You touch the door, and the freezing sensation makes you take a step back, which causes you to slip on the 
				stairs. As you fall, you let out a massive blood-curdling scream whilst everything surrounding you 
				abruptly goes black...
