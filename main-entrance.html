				<p>As you approach the main entrance, there is an opening into grass and a sea view, but it is shrouded
				in a darkness that seems darker than the night itself. This part of the fortress seems to be completely 
				intact inside, which means no light is seeping in from holes in the roof or walls. It only takes a few 
				seconds to walk through the entrance and back into the light, but something about that darkness makes you 
				feel uneasy. Now, you stand within the Inner Court. You can head straight on towards a well and 
				the sea view, go left into the remains of Douglas Tower or you can go right, which leads to some spiral 
				stairs within the East Tower.
