				<p>You head towards a hallway which is housed between the Douglas Tower and the North Range which has been 
				lost to the sea cliffs and damaged in the 1651 siege. The Douglas Tower is said to have been a mighty 
				six-storeyed tower, which would have housed The Red Douglases Earl of that time. The North Range had an 
				upper and lower hall. The upper was used for entertaining the Earl's guests and the lower for the household 
				until it was turned into storage in the 1500s. Turning left leads to downward stairs in The Douglas Tower, 
				forward leads to the upper hall, right leads into the lower hall or you can head back.
