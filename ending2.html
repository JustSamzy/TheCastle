				<p>After having a look round the reception shop, you decide to grab a coffee and a souvenir of the trip. 
				As the teller rings up your items, they ask you how your trip was. You begin to describe the odd music 
				coming from the stairway of the prison, but the teller gives you a rather puzzling and un-nerving look. 
				After asking if anyone else has experienced this, they say "No, however some people have recalled hearing 
				a boy singing within the grounds." Although this does not help much, you thank the teller and head back 
				to your car. The music is always at the back of your mind, and from time to time you remember this trip 
				and still cannot explain it.
