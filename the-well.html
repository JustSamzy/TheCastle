				<p>As you continue forward into the Inner Court, you approach a well. A plaque on the well says: 
				"sunk through the rock to a depth of over 32 meters. The castle's main freshwater supply." This well 
				had been re-excavated in the 19th-centruy, and currently has a metal grate covering as well as moss 
				growing. Curiosity gets the better of you and you attempt to peer down the well, as you look down the 
				darkness it stores gives you similar chills from when you entered. As you look forward the sea-view even 
				from the court is mesmerising.
