				<p>You stop on the stairwell landing. Suddenly, out of nowhere you can hear music playing, it is faint but 
				noticeable. Looking around the landing space you see no gaps in the stone, and no natural light is even 
				peeping through the walls of the stairway. You begin to listen closely; it sounds like a woodwind 
				instrument like a Shawm. This noise makes you feel rather unsettled, because there does not seem to be any 
				obvious reason or its origin in front of you. No one seems to be close by the top of the stairs or the 
				surrounding hallway.
